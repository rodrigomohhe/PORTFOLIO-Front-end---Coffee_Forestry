<h1>PORTFOLIO - Front-end - Coffee_Forestry</h1>

<h2>About this:</h2>
<p>This project is part of a portfolio of my achivements on Front-end. Here I try and display some skills on HTML and CSS, learned through #Alura courses and research. I emphasize that this project is still in development and I would be very much pleased from hearing tips and observations from the community. In this project I intend to create a website for a coffee production and distribution cooperative, called Coffee Forestry, that has as precept to apply only agroforestry methods of cultivation as a initiative for more sustainable practices.</p>

<h2>My goals with this project:</h2>
